We advise to go upwards from there. The 2nd field needs to be a phrase that you must first add using our language manager. Once you add a phrase it gives you several examples of how to use the phrase. We will be using the \"Text\" method, which is basically the variable name of the phrase and how we will connect to this specific word. So the 2nd value needs to be a phrase that identifies this gender. For Male and Female we used his and her. The 3rd value identifies the gender and must also be a phrase much like the 2nd value. For male and female we used Male and Female to populate this value.<\/info>",
